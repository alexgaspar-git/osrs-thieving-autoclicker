# osrs-thieving-autoclicker

AHK V2 script for a simple randomized autoclicker that only clicks when on the RuneLite window.

I made this because I'm too young to develop carpal tunnel syndrome for a videogame.

Shift + S is the default On/Off toggle.

Shift + 2 to reload the script (acts as a reset).

Shift + 3 to exit the script.
