# osrs-thieving-autoclicker

AHK v2.0 script for a simple randomized autoclicker that only clicks when on the RuneLite window.

I made this because I'm too young to develop carpal tunnel syndrome for a videogame.

### How to run

Download AutoHotKey v2.0 from https://www.autohotkey.com/

Double click on thieving-autoclicker.ahk

Shift + S is the default On/Off toggle.

Shift + 2 to reload the script (acts as a reset).

Shift + 3 to exit the script.
